      Add docs for GraphQL in Gloo Edge, after testing locally. Update a handful of lines of code in e2e test utils
      to be used in enterprise e2e tests. This includes adding headers to `ReceivedRequest` struct as well as a small
      bug fix to the test util for setting the body on the received request.
