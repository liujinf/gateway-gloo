changelog:
  - type: NON_USER_FACING
    description: >
      There used to be a hardcoded dependency in between the TAGGED_VERSION environment variable
      and the url of the released docs. Since we need the url of the released docs to be the version
      number of the branch with the patch set to 0 (e.g. 1.3.0), we need to decouple them.
