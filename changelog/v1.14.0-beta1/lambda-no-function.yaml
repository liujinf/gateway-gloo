  - type: NEW_FEATURE
    description: >
      Add option that allows usage of lambda upstreams without specifying a function.
      Affects custom extensions of the lambda extension built in go that use gloo as a library.
      This is purely a work around for current Gloo Portal behavior and likely should not be opted into otherwise.
