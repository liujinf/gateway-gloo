  description: >-
    Audit use of gomega.Consistently with channel receives. This is because the
    default duration and interval are 100ms and 10ms respectively, which are
    very short considering we're using unbuffered channels. The consequence of
    this could be developers trusting that behavior is safe because the test did
    not fail when in actuality, an error could have come in before the Consistently
    call and was missed due to the unbuffered channel, or the error happened after
    the default 100ms duration. The goal is to encourage developers to consider
    and use explicit durations and intervals in Consistently calls.
