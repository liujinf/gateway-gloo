  description: >
    Upgrade docker distribution dependency which fixes CVE-2023-2253 for all images except kubectl.
    Also add the CVE to .trivyignore because kubectl does not have a fixed version yet and kubectl
    is not vulnerable. Upgrade openssl version in kubectl image to fix CVE-2023-2650.
