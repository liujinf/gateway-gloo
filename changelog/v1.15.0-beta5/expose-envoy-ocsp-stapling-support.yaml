    description: >-
      Expose Envoy's OCSP Stapling support through two new fields: `ocsp_staple` and `ocsp_staple_policy`.
      OCSP responses can be stored in TLS secrets through `glooctl create secret tls`, or by manually storing the OCSP response in a k8s tls secret under the `data` field: `tls.ocsp-staple`.
      The `tls.ocsp-staple` secret field name is subject to change, and is currently based off of the naming used by cert-manager in this [WIP PR](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/pull/5830).
