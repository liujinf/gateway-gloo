    description: >-
      Add docs and tests to integrate Gloo Edge with the xds-relay project as an xds cache to increase availability
      in the event of Gloo pod failure as an xds server. Update the helm chart to allow configuring Gloo Edge to look
      at the xds-relay pods to get xds config rather than from gloo directly.
