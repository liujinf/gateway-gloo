    description: > 
      Remove helm charts that created gateway deployment and service accounts. Also remove some unreachable code to start
      the gateway process and the Dockerfile to build the image.
      Update the version mismatch check in glooctl to look at a newly added annotation on the gloo pod instead of the 
      tag in the gateway pod. Previously we relied on the gateway pod as a way to find the OSS version in an enterprise install.
