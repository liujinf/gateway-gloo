    description: >
      Choosing to ignore helm upgrade, as it does not impact the data and control planes of Gloo Edge.
      This only impacts GlooCtl and since it is not a long running service, panics will not affect future uses of Glooclt client.
      It is therefore deemed to have little to no impact.
