    description: Add helm customization (pod spec fields, resource requirements, disabling istio injection) that was missing from the `gloo-resource-rollout`, `gloo-resource-migration`, and `gloo-resource-cleanup` jobs. Allow disabling the jobs (not recommended unless default Gateways/Upstreams are not needed).
