      Enterprise-Only: Introduce a new `GraphQLSchema` CR (k8s custom resource) and API that allows users to send
      GraphQL requests to the Gloo Edge API gateway and resolves those requests according to schemas and resolvers
      defined on the CR. Add a new `Route` type called `graphql_schema_ref` that refers routs to the graphql
      configuration necessary to resolve the request. The API introduced here is only implemented in enterprise.
