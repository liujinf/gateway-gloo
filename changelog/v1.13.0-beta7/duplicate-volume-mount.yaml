      Remove the duplicate VolumeMount definition on the Gloo Deployment.
      If upgrading Gloo using the Fluxv2 stack, the Helm-Controller would emit an error about duplicate keys,
      and fail the upgrade. Anyone using the Helm CLI would not encounter an error, but would have one of the
      VolumeMount defintions applied, which could lead to errors.

      Redact Artifact contents when stringifying the Gloo API Snapshot. Previously Secrets were redacted,
      as they contain sensitive information. It's possible that ConfigMaps could as well, so we redact
      Artifacts as well.
