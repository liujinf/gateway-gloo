      This features exposes envoy's access log filters in gloo.  The Envoy definitions are documented here: 
      https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.24.1/api-v3/config/accesslog/v3/accesslog.proto#config-accesslog-v3-accesslogfilter
      and the Gloo interface uses the same definitions. These filters are used to only send certain entries to the access logs,
      for example based on status codes or a random sampling.
