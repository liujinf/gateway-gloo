    description: >-
      Exposes the RespectDnsTtl and DnsRefreshRate fields in the Upstream API.
      For DnsRefreshRate, If the DNS refresh rate is specified and the cluster type is
      either STRICT_DNS, or LOGICAL_DNS, this value is used as the cluster’s DNS refresh rate.
      The RespectDnsTtl is an optional configuration for setting cluster’s DNS refresh rate.
      If the value is set to true, cluster’s DNS refresh rate will be set to resource record’s
      TTL which comes from DNS resolution.
