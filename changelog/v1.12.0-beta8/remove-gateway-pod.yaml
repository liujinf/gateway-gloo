    description: >
      To reduce cross-pod communication, move the functionality from the gateway pod into the gloo pod. Specifically, the
      validation webhook is moved to the gloo pod which reduces the number of GRPC calls required for validation. Also
      while previously translation was done in two separate loops - one in the gateway pod to generate proxies and one in
      the gloo pod to generate Envoy configuration. Merging the translation loops allows us to optionally keep proxies in
      memory which reduces the time spent reading, persisting and marshalling/unmarshalling large CRs to etcd.
