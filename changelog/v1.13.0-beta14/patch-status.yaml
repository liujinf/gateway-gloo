changelog:
  - type: FIX
    resolvesIssue: false
    description: >-
      Use kubectl patch rather than read then write pattern to update status on custom resources, which
      makes gloo a less noisy client to the k8s apiserver. **NOTE: Users will need to apply new CRDs with
      this release to get CRD field defaulting behavior that this fix depends on, or else status updates
      to brand new resources (i.e. `status` or `status.statuses` does not exist) will fail.**
      Even if these status updates fail, data-plane traffic and control-plane updates will be
      unaffected and work as usual.
