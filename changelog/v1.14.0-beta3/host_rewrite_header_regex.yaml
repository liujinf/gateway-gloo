    description: >
      Expose Envoy route option host_rewrite_path_regex, which indicates that during forwarding, the host header will be swapped with
      the result of the regex substitution executed on path value with query and fragment removed. This is useful
      for transitioning variable content between path segment and subdomain. Using this option will append the x-forwarded-host
      header if append_x_forwarded_host is set. See https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/config/route/v3/route_components.proto
