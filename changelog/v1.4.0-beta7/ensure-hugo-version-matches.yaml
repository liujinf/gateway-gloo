    description: >
      Ensure hosted docs hugo version locally matches the version in CI, so any containers built locally match
      containers built in CI. Also updates the CI hugo version to a newer hugo version that renders our bulleted lists
      properly. (see http://localhost:1313/guides/security/access_logging/ for an example on older hugo versions that
      don't render properly)
