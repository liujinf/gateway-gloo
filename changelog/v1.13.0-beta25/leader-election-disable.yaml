    description: >-
      Expose a new Helm value `gloo.disableLeaderElection` which is false by default.
      Gloo will run leader election to support high availability, even if there is only
      1 replica. This configuration, when set to true, will explicitly disable leader election,
      regardless of the number of replicas.

    description: >-
      Allow leader election to be disabled in Gloo by configuring the DISABLE_LEADER_ELECTION
      environment variable to a truthy value. Previously, it could not be disabled explicitly.
