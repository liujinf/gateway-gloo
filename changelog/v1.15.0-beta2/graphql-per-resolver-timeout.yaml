    (Enterprise Only) Introduce ability to configure timeouts for individual resolutions within a GraphQL query. Additionally, default the
    resolver timeout to that configured on the upstream, if any. The per-resolution timeout will overwrite the upstream
    timeout, and if neither are set then the default timeout of 1 second will be applied.
