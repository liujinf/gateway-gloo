      Add extauth and ratelimit settings to Gateway httpGateway.options.extauth and httpGateway.options.ratelimit.
      This takes precedence over the global extauth and ratelimit settings on the Settings object, and allows users to set
      per-gateway extauth or rate-limit configuration for a set of virtual services.
