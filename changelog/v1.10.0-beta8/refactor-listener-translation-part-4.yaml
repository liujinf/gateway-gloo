      Cleanup HttpConnectionManager translation. Previously, the HCM plugin would modify
      all filter chains on a single listener. Gloo previously only exposed a configuration
      for a single HCM. As we expose hybrid gateway's, we'll expose multiple HCM config
      for a single listener.
      At it's core, this just converted the existing HCM plugin (which copied core config
      and iterated all HcmPlugins), into a type of HCM plugin, and we have a translator
      responsible for iterating over all HcmPlugins.
