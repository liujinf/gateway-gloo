    description: >-
      Cleanup the zipkin_test, by ensuring that we wrap the request and trace assertion in 
      a single eventually, instead of separate assertions. This pattern is used elsewhere
      in the file, but the one place it was not flaked. Also cleaned up the test to place
      assertion descriptions in the proper place.

    description: >-
      Delete unused test services. These services weren't being used in our tests and haven't
      been updated in years so they were only misleading developers.
