changelog:
- type: FIX
  description: >
    With proxy garbage collection enabled (enabled by default via `disableProxyGarbageCollection`=`false`),
    Gloo used to clear the extauth and ratelimit snapshots from the XDS cache, resulting in null configurations
    temporarily in the extauth and ratelimit services. This caused blips of invalid 403/429 responses. To fix
    this, Gloo now detects any valid `TranslatorSyncerExtension`'s Envoy Node ID keys through its `Sync()`
    function, so Gloo doesn't garbage collect these snapshots anymore.
