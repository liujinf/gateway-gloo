    description: >
      Expose a new Gateway option, in the Settings API: isolate_virtual_hosts_by_ssl_config.
      If set, group virtual hosts by matching ssl config, and isolate them on separate filter chains
      The default behavior is to aggregate all virtual hosts, and expose them on identical filter chains,
      each with a FilterChainMatch that corresponds to the ssl config.
      Individual Gateways can override this behavior by configuring the "gateway.solo.io/isolate_vhost" annotation
      to be a truthy ("true", "false") value
