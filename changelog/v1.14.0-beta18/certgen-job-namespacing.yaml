    description: >
      Setting `global.glooRbac.namespaced=true` now also constrains the certgen jobs access permissions to secrets from 
      the entire cluster to just those in the gloo install namespace. Also the original role 
      (`gloo-gateway-secret-create-vwc-update`) was split into two separate roles 
      (`gloo-gateway-secret-create` and `gloo-gateway-vwc-update`) as `gloo-gateway-vwc-update` needs to access cluster scoped 
      validatingWebhookConfigs. `gloo-gateway-secret-create-vwc-update` no longer exists.
