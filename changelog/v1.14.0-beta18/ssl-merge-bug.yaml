      In the Settings object, you can configure `gateway.isolateVirtualHostsBySslConfig` to ensure that
      VirtualHosts, secured with SslConfig, are published to unique filter chains. We attempt to merge VirtualServices
      which share the same SslConfiguration. There was a bug in the merge logic that caused VirtualServices to be
      dropped from the Proxy, and only the last matching VirtualService would remain, if you were using 
      `isolateVirtualHostsBySslConfig=true`.
