changelog:
  - type: FIX
    description: >
      We allow virtual services, route tables, and upstreams to refer to an upstream by name only, leaving the namespace field empty. Gloo will assume that the upstream's namespace is the namespace of the parent resource (the upstream group, virtual service or route table). Previously, this caused Envoy to be in a bad state, and the route would return a 503 error.
