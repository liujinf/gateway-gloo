    description: >
      When static upstreams are converted to Envoy clusters, add hostnames to each
      endpoint so that host headers for requests and healthchecks are set to the endpoint
      hostname rather than the Envoy cluster name. This change only applies if `autoHostRewrite`
      is set to true on route routing to the static upstream.
