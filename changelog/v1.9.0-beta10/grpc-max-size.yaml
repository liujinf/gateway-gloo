    description: >
      Remove `validationServerGrpcMaxSize`. Instead use `validationServerGrpcMaxSizeBytes`,
      which is a replacement for `validationServerGrpcMaxSize`. `validationServerGrpcMaxSizeBytes`
      is now an int32, which fixes the int64 version's broken functionality.

    description: >
      Adding the `validationServerGrpcMaxSize` caused all pods to crash when using the
      settings CRD, this will no longer happen with `validationServerGrpcMaxSizeBytes`.
