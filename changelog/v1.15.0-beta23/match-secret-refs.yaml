    description: > 
         Add an environment variable "HEADER_SECRET_REF_NS_MATCHES_US" that when set in the gloo pod requires that secrets
         sent in headers to an upstream are in the same namespace as that upstream. This defaults to false and when it is not set,
         resources can be in any namespaces watched by Gloo.
