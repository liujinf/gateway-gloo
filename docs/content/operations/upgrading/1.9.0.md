title: 1.9.0+ Upgrade Notice
weight: 40
description: Migrating to Gloo Edge 1.9.x and Gloo Edge Enterprise 1.9.x
---

Follow these steps to upgrade your Gloo Edge or Gloo Edge Enterprise deployments to version 1.9 from version 1.8. If
your Gloo Edge deployment runs a version older than 1.8, make sure to [upgrade to 1.8]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/operations/upgrading/1.8.0" >}}) before upgrading to 1.9.

This upgrade guide assumes that you installed Gloo Edge with Helm or `glooctl`. You can verify this installation by checking for a Helm chart release named `gloo` in the output of `helm ls --all-namespaces`.

For steps to avoid downtime during upgrades, check out the [Recommended settings]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/operations/upgrading/upgrade_steps#upgrading-the-server-components" >}}).

## CRD field updates

Any new fields added to our CRDs (e.g. added between 1.8.0 -> 1.9.0) need to be added to our validation schemas.

To apply the new CRDs:
```
helm pull gloo/gloo --version $GLOO_VERSION --untar #e.g. GLOO_VERSION=1.9.0
kubectl apply -f gloo/crds
```

{{% notice note %}}
To support Kubernetes 1.22, Gloo Edge CRDs are now written with the `v1` rather than the `v1beta1` API. CRDs that persisted as `v1beta1` are converted to the new `v1` API when read in Kubernetes 1.22.

## Verify upgrade
To verify that your upgrade was successful, let's first check the version:

```shell script
glooctl version
```

You should see the expected version for all the server components.

Let's also check that your Gloo Edge installation is healthy by running:

```shell script
glooctl check
```

If everything went well, you should see the following output:

```shell script
Checking deployments... OK
Checking pods... OK
Checking upstreams... OK
Checking upstream groups... OK
Checking auth configs... OK
Checking rate limit configs... OK
Checking VirtualHostOptions... OK
Checking RouteOptions... OK
Checking secrets... OK
Checking virtual services... OK
Checking gateways... OK
Checking proxies... OK
No problems detected.
```
