description: How do I replace an expired license for Gloo Edge Enterprise?

Gloo Edge Enterprise requires a time-limited license key in order to fully operate. You initially provide this license at installation time, as described [here]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/installation/enterprise/" >}}).

The license key is stored as a Kubernetes secret in the cluster. When the key expires, the pods that mount the secret might crash. To update the license key, patch the secret and restart the Gloo Edge deployments.

{{% notice tip %}}
When you first install Gloo Edge in your cluster, confirm the license key expiration date with your Account Representative, such as in **30 days**. Then, set a reminder for before the license key expires, and complete these steps, such as on Day 30, so that your Gloo Edge pods do not crash.

## Confirm that your license expired

Whether you're a prospective user using a trial license or a full Gloo Edge subscriber, this license can expire. When it does, you may see certain Gloo Edge pods start to display errors that are new to you.

For example, from the following [k9s](https://k9scli.io/) display, you can see that certain `gloo-system` pods fall into a `CrashLoopBackoff` state.

![k9s Display with Expired License]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/img/k9s-license-expired.png" %}})

Next, you can use `glooctl check` to confirm that the deployments have errors.

```bash
% glooctl check
Checking deployments... 3 Errors!
Checking pods... 6 Errors!
Checking upstreams... OK
Checking upstream groups... OK

```

Finally, to get a more precise diagnosis, look at the logs for the failing `observability` deployment.

```bash
% kubectl logs deploy/observability -n gloo-system
{"level":"fatal","ts":1628879186.1552186,"logger":"observability","caller":"cmd/main.go:24","msg":"License is invalid or expired, crashing - license expired","version":"1.8.0","stacktrace":"main.main\n\t/workspace/solo-projects/projects/observability/cmd/main.go:24\nruntime.main\n\t/usr/local/go/src/runtime/proc.go:225"}
```

You can confirm that the license key is expired by copying and pasting your current license key into the [jwt.io debugger](http://jwt.io). Note that the date indicated by the `exp` header is in the past.

## Replace the Expired License

If you're a new user whose trial license has expired, contact your Solo.io Account Representative for a new license key, or fill out [this form](https://lp.solo.io/request-trial). Make sure to note the expiration date so that you can later replace this new license key before it expires.

The Gloo Edge Enterprise license is installed by default into a Kubernetes `Secret` named `license` in the `gloo-system` namespace. If that is the case for your installation, then you can use a simple bash script to replace the expired key by patching the `license` secret:

```bash
GLOO_KEY=your-new-enterprise-key-string
echo $GLOO_KEY | base64 | read output;kubectl patch secret license -n gloo-system -p="{\"data\":{\"license-key\": \"$output\"}}" -v=1
```

If successful, this script should respond with: `secret/license patched`.

## Verify the New License

To quickly test whether the new license has resolved your problem, try restarting all the deployments that were stuck in `CrashLoopBackoff` state, like this:

```bash
% kubectl rollout restart deployment observability -n gloo-system
deployment.apps/observability restarted
% kubectl rollout restart deployment gloo-fed-console -n gloo-system
deployment.apps/gloo-fed-console restarted
% kubectl rollout restart deployment gloo-fed -n gloo-system
deployment.apps/
gloo-fed restarted
```

Taking a fresh look at the k9s console shows us that all three of the failing pods have recently restarted -- see the `AGE` attribute -- and are now in a healthy state.

Congratulations! You have successfully replaced your Gloo Edge Enterprise license key.
